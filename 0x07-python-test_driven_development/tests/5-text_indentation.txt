===========================

Using ``text_indentation``
----------------------

First import ``print_square`` from the ``Print Square`` module:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

Now use it:

	>>> text_indentation("Once upon a time. There was a village: smurfs village ? Did you ever hear about it?")
	Once upon a time.
	<BLANKLINE>
	There was a village:
	<BLANKLINE>
	smurfs village ?
	<BLANKLINE>
	Did you ever hear about it?
	<BLANKLINE>

	>>> text_indentation(3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
	TypeError: text must be a string

	>>> text_indentation([7, 5])
	Traceback (most recent call last):
